# Lab-1-Utility-Server
homework assignment for 12.4.18
Task
You will create an Express server that takes in different routes to do random but COOL things!
Each of the routes are unique and takes in query parameters through GET requests
Each of the individual functionalities should be seperated into modules that you will build
Your routes should test for invalid inputs
Features
// Math Routes
localhost:3000/math/add?a=2&b=3
localhost:3000/math/subtract?a=2&b=3
localhost:3000/math/divide?a=2&b=3
localhost:3000/math/multiply?a=2&b=3

// Search Gif Route
localhost:3000/gif/?search=spongebob
Math Routes Example
If we entered the following:

localhost:3000/math/add?a=2&b=3
We should get back the following response:

{
  input: {
    a: 2,
    b: 3
  },
  sumString: '2 + 3',
  sum: 5
}
This example applies for every one of the math routes.

A more complex example:

localhost:3000/math/multiply?cat=50&b=3&zoo=10
We should get back the following response:

{
  input: {
    cat: 50,
    b: 3,
    zoo: 10
  },
  productString: '50 * 3 * 10',
  product: 1500
}
The user can enter as many query parameters as they want to do the math function on. AND be able to call them whatever they want.

Gif Search Example
If they user searches the following:

localhost:3000/gif/?search=spongebob
Your response should be like the following:

[
  "https://media1.giphy.com/media/cZ7rmKfFYOvYI/200.gif",
  "https://media1.giphy.com/media/cZ7rmKfFYOvYI/200.gif"
]
You will use the Giphy API to do your GIF search.
Parse through their results.
Respond back with an array of ONLY the direct GIF image URL. Where the image URL ends with .gif
